:::info FULL SUPPORT
This device/board is currently fully supported
:::

![STM32MP157C-DK2](../assets/STM32MP157C-DK2_angle2.jpg)

Using this device is very simple. Connect:

- plug-in the SD Card in the board slot.
- Ethernet
- Connect a USB cable to the ST-Link port
- Power supply

![STM32MP157C-DK2](../assets/STM32MP157C-DK2_connections.png)

After the power supply is connected the device will start booting. At
this point we can attach a shell session to the device's ST-Link port
using a program called [Minicom](https://wiki.emacinc.com/wiki/Getting_Started_With_Minicom). If it is not already installed on your system, run the following commands

```bash
sudo apt-get install minicom
```

then try to connect to the default serial port:

```bash
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
```

:::note
This port name may change depending on your setup, another variant is
**ttySTM0**
:::
if the boot process goes fine, you should see something like is shown
below in the Minicom terminal, otherwise there might be a problem during
the boot stage on your device.

stm32mp1 login:
```

in case you do not see the login line, press **enter** , then as user
type **root** and no password is required.

[ST documentation](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/Getting_started/STM32MP1_boards/STM32MP157x-DK2/Let%27s_start) is excellent, and you can find plenty of information there.

## Check application service

The last step is to check if the application service is running on the
device, to do so execute the following command in the minicom port:

```bash
ps
```

the output might look like:

```text
 247 root      4304 S    sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups
  250 root     11116 S    /usr/sbin/tee-supplicant -d
  252 root         0 IW<  [optee_bus_scan]
  258 root     10584 S    /usr/sbin/tee-substrate-service
  264 root      2328 S    /sbin/syslogd -n -O /var/log/messages
  269 root      2328 S    /sbin/klogd -n
  272 root      2328 S    /usr/sbin/ifplugd
  277 root      2328 S    {start_getty} /bin/sh /bin/start_getty 115200 ttySTM
  278 root      2328 S    /sbin/getty 38400 tty1
  280 root      2416 S    -sh
  323 root         0 IW   [kworker/1:1-eve]
  344 root         0 IW   [kworker/1:0-eve]
  357 root      2416 R    ps
root@stm32mp1:~#
```

The **ps** command lists the processes that are running in the device, and you
must see the application process called **tee-substrate-service**.

:::note
The tee-substrate-service is a demon process that waits for requests
through **tcp://localhost:39946**, check [docs](../intro) to know how to ensure
the service does what is supposed to do.
